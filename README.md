# Mobile-Sales-Dashboard
The main objective of this project is to develop an interactive and insightful dashboard using Power BI to analyze mobile phone sales data. This dashboard is designed to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), identify sales trends, and help in making informed business decisions..

Key Aims:

KPI Tracking: To monitor crucial metrics such as Total Sales, Quantity Sold, Total Transactions, and Average Sales Price.

Time-Series Analysis: To understand sales performance over time by analyzing month-over-month or year-over-year growth.

Product Analysis: To identify which mobile brands and models are performing best and which are underperforming.

Geographical Analysis: To analyze sales performance by region or city to identify the most profitable markets.

Data-Driven Decisions: To empower sales managers and stakeholders to build strategies and identify opportunities for improvement based on data.

Plan of Action / Methodology
The following steps were taken to create this dashboard:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Raw sales data was collected (e.g., from CSV or Excel files).

The data was cleaned and transformed using the Power Query Editor. This included handling null values, correcting data types, and removing irrelevant columns.

Data Modeling:

A robust data model was created to organize the data effectively.

Relationships were established between a fact table (e.g., Sales) and several dimension tables (e.g., Product, Date, Region) to create a Star Schema.

DAX Calculations:

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to create custom measures and calculated columns for in-depth analysis.

For instance, DAX formulas were written to calculate key metrics like Total Revenue, Total Quantity Sold, and Year-over-Year Sales Growth %.

Visualization and Dashboard Design:

Various charts and graphs (such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and maps) were used to present the data effectively.

KPIs were displayed prominently using Card visuals.

Slicers and filters were added to allow users to dynamically filter the data according to their needs.

The dashboard was designed with a clean, professional, and user-friendly layout.
Insights and Deployment:

Actionable business insights were derived from the final dashboard.

Finally, the dashboard was published to the Power BI Service to be easily accessed and utilized by stakeholders.
